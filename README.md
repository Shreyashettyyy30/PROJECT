# PROJECT
Hello am shreya!
My micro project is about creating a form and saving the data to database.
In this project i tried hard and created a form where a person is able to fill all his details.
But i dont have enough knowledge on how to store the information filled in database.
Ill be trying to improve my skills on this.
JSONDB is an excellent,easy,simple platform to use and to create many relational databases.
The below is the code which i used to create a form with required information.
